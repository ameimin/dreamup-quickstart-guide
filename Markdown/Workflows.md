# Popular Workflows
## Prompting

* Prompt length matters. Shorter will show default styles. Longer text will result in more unique results.

* Grammar rules are not understood by these models. Neither are commas.

* Be specific with words and details. For example, suggest flowers with purple petals instead of flowers or a garden. 

* Use parentheses to emphasize words.

* Discord is a great place to learn about effective prompts and workflows. See [Using Discord](https://dreamup.ai/ "Using Discord").

* Reddit is another source. See further details on both below.

## How to make your images look good

## Text to Image Workflow

* Text to image uses a written prompt to create a matching image.

* Prompts can be very simple, and word choice is important for the best results. 

* For negative prompting, see the [Quick Terms](https://dreamup.ai/ "Quick Terms") section.

## Image to Image Workflow

* Image to image is when a user attaches an image to get a similar result.

* Image to image uses the attached image to modify that image from the original.

* In this version, AI uses the image and puts it in the model style, guided by your prompt.

## Background Removal

* DreamUp.ai doesn't have background removal as a feature.

* To remove the background, use an all-black image as a starting image.

* There are multiple background removal options online, accessible with a quick search.

## Fixed Seed Variation

* Explore prompt changes by using fixed seed and only changing your prompt.
