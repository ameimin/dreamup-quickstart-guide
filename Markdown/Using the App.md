## Image Content Filters

There are two choices for inappropriate content filters on DreamUp. Choose the filter by toggling your filter option.

Here are the differences:

### Frigg Checker (Coming Soon)
* This model evaluates the prompt before creating the image. 
* This filter is recommended for those that want permitted erotic content. Erotic content allowed on DreamUp may be displayed, including adult nudity. 
* The filter blocks results based on the goal of the image expressed in the prompt. Requests for child pornography will be denied.
* Specific keywords determine whether the image is blocked.

### Stable Diffusion Safety Checker
* This creates a set of images first. It blocks specific images based on certain features.
* Nudity with certain body parts, including breasts and genitals, will be blocked. In general, a larger proportion of images are blocked by this filter.
* Examples of appropriate content that may be blocked: some flowers, men or boy, goth girls, or lolita.
* This safety check blocks some nudity in anime, fantasy images, renaissance art, nude paintings, etc.
