Using the Application
Users are ready to start creating once logged into their account.

     1. Go to the Create tab at the top menu.



     2. Select the model type. See AI Models for further details on the different models.



     3. Type in your prompt. Start simply and add details as you go along to get the best results. For example, a comic figure with superpowers to throw fire is better than a comic figure. 

     4. The appropriate model tokens will appear depending on your selection. Adjust the random seed, width, height, steps, and guidance. See Signing Up for further details.

     5. Add an image from a website or upload one from your computer. This is an optional step.

      6. Change the model tokens in the main creator. Using the model tokens increases how much the model's particular style is imparted.

      7. Clicking the token will add it to your prompt.


     6. Click the Submit button.



Please note: Once you become a recurring donor (subscriber), it is required to log out and sign in again to enable any extra features.
