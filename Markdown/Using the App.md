     3. Type in your prompt. Start simply and add details as you go along to get the best results. For example, a comic figure with superpowers to throw fire is better than a comic figure. 

     4. The appropriate model tokens will appear depending on your selection. Adjust the random seed, width, height, steps, and guidance. See [Signing Up](https:// "Signing Up") for further details.

     5. Add an image from a website or upload one from your computer. This is an optional step.

      6. Change the model tokens in the main creator. Using the model tokens increases how much the model's particular style is imparted.
