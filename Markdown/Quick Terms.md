Quick Terms
Collection: A set of image results from your output.




Guidance: Higher guidance keeps to the prompt more literally. It can decrease the quality of the image.




Model Tokens: Tokens are the basic units of text or code that AI uses to process and generate images. Model tokens can be thought of as words.


Negative Prompt: A written prompt with criteria of what you don't want in the image. These prompts can help create PG images by removing NFSW results. 


Prompt: Words the AI uses to create an image. Prompts can be very long. Start simple and add information as you go along to create the best result.


Steps: Determines the strength of the image. More steps lead to a higher-quality image but increases generation time. Thirty-five steps is a good place to start.


Random Seed: A generator that will produce the same image if set to that image.


Scheduler: Impacts a mild style on the image.


Stable Diffusion: A deep learning text-to-image model.
